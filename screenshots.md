Changed the fonts and added lenses to the eye glasses to look slightly more realistic. The arrows on the sign are also hand drawn in GIMP.

I really liked this combination of fonts. I was able to play around with this website for a while. I definitely wanted a more naturally bold text for the text on the buildings and font that would match with that for the signs.

Added eye glasses to the image to enhance the metaphor of actually "looking" into the future and the past.

Not only did I add signs that are to be pointing to the right for the future and to the left for the past, but I began to mess with filters a bit in this process. Originally I wanted to have a gradient of blurriness gradually getting more clear as you head toward the future, but I did not like how that product looked. I finally came to the conclusion that I want the past to be unfocused and the future to be very clear and distinct. I finally found the "linear motion" filter that made the left side of the image very out of focus. I still have to add arrows to the signs and start playing around with the fonts. I am contemplating on how/where I want to put the words in the image. I feel like I don't necessarily need to put a quote because I feel right now that the image says enough, but I may either put the words going up the page vertically along the road or have window washers transcribing the words into the glass on the future side.

In this version of the image I was able to add borders to the silhouettes in both sides of the image (the past side and the future side). By doing this, I was able to make the characters pop more and assign them some sort of hierarchy. I also changed the color of the negative space used in each of the characters to symbolize a few things. The past side has a darker color to sort of blend in with the past, and the future side has a brighter appearance to show a new "enlightened" self. However, the border that they each have shows how there is still part of the past in the future version of the self and part of the future is still on the outside of the past self. Notice how the future self is looking back on their dark past, and they are now so close to the future.

In the "preview.md" file shown above, I am trying to show the rhetorical claim that your past does not define your future. I started out by taking a background of a cartoon-ish city and separating it into two parts: the past and the future. Then I had to find characters to place on each of these time zones. I was able to source a pack of various silhouettes that I thought was perfect for this project (All images that I sourced online can show attributions and licenses in the assets.md file). I then have two signs that are going to be pointing to the right for the future and to the left for the past. Notice that the distances on these signs are significantly different by a great magnitude. I am showing how it is easy to proceed to the future, but it is near impossible to go back to the past. From this point on, I generally know where I want this project to go, and I want to do this by assigning more of a difference between positive and negative spaces. The background image that I found is quite busy, so I will be working on a way to reduce this, probably by applying a pixel filter that I came across when messing around in my own studio time. My idea is to start from heavily pixelated on the left side and gradually decrease pixelization to an ultimately clear image on the "future"(right) side of this image. I still do not know how I am going to incorporate some kind of quote, but I would like to put one somewhere. At this point I am open to suggestions on how I might be able to do this, but I am currently thinking of assigning some negative space to the top right corner of the buildings to be able to add this quote. At the same time, I am questioning to myself, "Do I even need to include a quote or does my image say enough?".
