In the "preview.md" file shown above, I am trying to show the rhetorical claim that your past does not define your future. I started out by taking a background of a cartoon-ish city and separating it into two parts: the past and the future. Then I had to find characters to place on each of these time zones. I was able to source a pack of various silhouettes that I thought was perfect for this project (All images that I sourced online can show attributions and licenses in the assets.md file). I then have two signs that are going to be pointing to the right for the future and to the left for the past. Notice that the distances on these signs are significantly different by a great magnitude. I am showing how it is easy to proceed to the future, but it is near impossible to go back to the past. From this point on, I generally know where I want this project to go, and I want to do this by assigning more of a difference between positive and negative spaces. The background image that I found is quite busy, so I will be working on a way to reduce this, probably by applying a pixel filter that I came across when messing around in my own studio time. My idea is to start from heavily pixelated on the left side and gradually decrease pixelization to an ultimately clear image on the "future"(right) side of this image. I still do not know how I am going to incorporate some kind of quote, but I would like to put one somewhere. At this point I am open to suggestions on how I might be able to do this, but I am currently thinking of assigning some negative space to the top right corner of the buildings to be able to add this quote. At the same time, I am questioning to myself, "Do I even need to include a quote or does my image say enough?".
