<h2>ForwardWithFuture</h2>
<p>
I had originally bounced around a couple of ideas for what I wanted my Visual Argument to represent. I decided to aim towards a sort of self reflective visualization such that a viewer can look at my graphic and motivate themselves to keep their head up or something along those lines. This is where I thought of the phrase, "Your past doesn't decide your future". I feel like a lot of times I tend to think of something that has happened in the past and it can sometimes be hard to look past the past (no pun intended). I do not think that I am the only one that feels this way and/or the only one who needs to hear something like this to keep my head up. In reality,  you are not really shaped by something that has happened to you in the past or what you have done to someone. It is important to realize tomorrow is a new day and you can not go back and change what you did yesterday, you can only change what you are going to do tomorrow.

The initial idea to represent this phrase was to have two people on the screen separated by some kind of barrier. One of the them is surrounded by the "past" and the other would be surrounded by the "future". If you follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/anatems1/visual-argument-2021spring/blob/d76f69bc699119e76b2f8bfaa5074987b3e9fd31/screenshots.md">screenshots.md</a> file on my repository, a breakdown of more screenshots taken during the entire studio process can be found. Below are both the original image for my project and the final image:

I am going to walkthrough a couple of the visual attributions I chose to assign to this specific project. To begin, I would like to asses and facilitate how I was able to meet the baseline criteria, then I am going to mention how I was able to meet some of the aspirational criteria.
<hr>
<b><u>Baseline Criteria</u></b>
<br>
<h5>Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus and guide viewers' attention.</h5>

I have a variety of contrasting colors that help guide the viewer from the "past" side of the image to the "future" side of the image. On the past side, the negative space is has a black color and the future side has a white negative space. This is supposed to aid the indication of the future being bright and with many colors and the past being dark and blurry (which also promotes the sense of visual rhythm or movement)

<h5>Have a clear message or intervention that you can articulate</h5>
The message is pretty clear, the character on the right is 0.01 mi from the future surrounded by a clear and colorful cityscape. The character on the left is 1000 mi away, a seemingly impossible distance compared to the 0.01 mi on the opposing side. Also the background is dull and visually distorted, showing that the past may not be as pretty as the future. Other than this, I was able to include a quote on the background's cityscape, "Your past doesn't decide your future" as described previously.

<h5>If including words, choose a font that matches the style/tone of your piece</h5>
The website <a href="https://fontjoy.com/">fontjoy.com</a> was very nice tool that helped me view deep learning-generated fonts that match each other. After playing around with this for a while, I was able to choose the Anton font as the font on the buildings and Averia Sans Libre-Regular as the text on the signs. I really like the subtle differences between this combination.

<h5>Credit all assets correctly, including attribution (creator names) where required</h5>

<h5>Use at least 3 layers</h5>
I use much more than three layers, which I will dive deeper in my aspirational criteria analysis.

<h5>Use at least 1 tool beyond select, move, and text</h5>
I also used much more than 1 tool beyond the basic tools, which I will also dive deeper in explaining.

<hr>
<b><u>Aspirational Criteria</u></b>
<br>
In this part of the assignment, I think that I really proved what I was able to learn with using GIMP. I have used GIMP briefly before just to resize images, but I have never dug this deep into all of the different features that the program has to use. Firstly, when you open my .xcf file, you will notice that I organized the layers by the "Past" side and the "Future" side as layer groups. Within each of these layer groups there are various layers comprised of the silhouettes, the text, the window washers, and the street signs. Above these layer groups are two additional layers comprised of the eye glass frames and a duplicated and blurred layer of the background.
<br></br>
Originally I did not include the frames in the image, and it was only the city with the two opposing sides (past and future). Also the text was positioned on the future building differently. This can be seen below:

</p>

I received a couple of comments from rearranging my text to flipping the character on the future side to facing the right of the screen rather than facing the past side.

</p>

I completely agree with this comment, which is why I flipped the image to face the opposite direction. It could be confusing as to why the character is facing the past if they are trying to move forward. Originally I thought of doing it this way because the character could be looking at the past and reflecting on it rather than dwelling on it, but I was not entirely sure how I could achieve this.

I decided to include the quote on the buildings to stray away from a quote just plainly panning across the top of the screen. Instead, the words are painted on the windows of the past and on the bricks of the future. By doing this, the window washers can easily clean off the words that were painted on the windows, metaphorically. However, they will definitely have a more difficult time, if even possible, from removing the words off of the bricks on the future side. By doing this, I was also able to take advantage of using the <a href="https://www.gridd.nl/en/2016/05/apply-gestalt-principles-ux-design/">principle of enclosure</a> (discussed in class) to separate this text into rows that were automatically available due to the design of the background city image. There is an obvious form of hierarchy shown in my graphic. The addition of the eye glasses also helped reinforce both the dominance of the image and the overall articulation of my message/argument. I am really happy that I chose to add in these eye glasses. Not only does it show you what the foreground is, but it guides the viewers eyes to dismiss whatever <h2>ForwardWithFuture</h2>

There is an obvious form of the hierarchy shown in my graphic. The addition of the eyeglasses also helped reinforce both the dominance of the image and the overall articulation of my message/argument. I am really happy that I chose to add in these eyeglasses. Not only does it show you what the foreground is, but it guides the viewer's eyes to dismiss whatever else is in the background and focus only on the characters, the signs, and what is happening on the building in the background. The viewer is almost actually physically "looking" into the future and the past with the glasses as well.

</p>
I was not entirely happy about the <i>orange</i> line around the eyeglasses, the gap between the frame and the background in the top corners, and the color of the lenses on the glasses (which there is none). After some fine-tuning, I was able to get rid of that orange border on the frame and erased the actual arms on the sides of the lenses. I fixed the gap between the glasses in the corners by selecting them and painting them with the color picker tool for the closest colors. Additionally in the final version of the image, I applied an "ice" pattern fill to the lenses at a low opacity to look more like you are actually looking into lenses rather than just the images in front of them. From here I will walk through some of the other tools I used, and why/how I used them. The two layers that comprise the background of the past had to be duplicated and merged to form the blurred background that is outside of the lenses. This blur was a product of the Gaussian Blur filter, tweaked to a specific value. I aimed to have a sort of motion-blurred effect on the past side, to also promote the movement from the past onward and make the past somewhat blurry compared to the clear future. This was accomplished by using the linear motion blur filter. To add a border to the silhouettes of the contrasting color, after using the fuzzy select tool on the layer, there was an option to select a specific border of x pixels. Once the border was selected, the bucket tool could be used to paint the entire selection a certain color. The colors on both the past and future sides of the image were also tweaked from various combinations of saturation and contrast tools under the color tool. The individual arrows on each of the signs were hand-drawn with the paint tool and bucket tool. With the paint tool, I was able to paint straight lines and mirror them to produce the outline of the arrow. The bucket tool was then used to fill the arrows with the white color as seen on a typical street sign. I really enjoyed this project, and I believe that I spent a lot of time trying to strengthen my message and make use of the various graphic design principles we discussed in class. I hope you, the viewer, will be able to achieve the same level of satisfaction from looking at my graphic as I do. Thank you for looking!
